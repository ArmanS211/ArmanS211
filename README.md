- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArmanS211.
- 👀 I’m interested in Frontend Development with React, JSX and outside of that, some C++ and Java projects for fun occasionally.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become a well-rounded frontend dev, mastering the intricacies of React and experimenting with different kinds of projects.
- ⚡ Fun fact: This is actually my second account, I lost my original one (ArmanS21) because after I graduated, my University email became inaccesible and I could no longer get into the account due to 2 Factor Authentication.
