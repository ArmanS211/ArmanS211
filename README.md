- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ArmanS211
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Frontend Development with React, JSX and outside of that, some C++ projects for fun occasionally.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to become a well-rounded frontend dev, mastering the intricacies of React and experimenting with different kinds of projects.
- âš¡ Fun fact: This is actually my second account, I lost my original one (ArmanS21) because after I graduated, the University took away my email and I could no longer get into the account due to 2 Factor Authentication being enabled.
